# Cyber-Training
Why is this important?  
The leadership of CyberVT believe that it is helpful to have a collection of learning resources for people new to cyber to learn the basics. We want to send you to competitions however, we want to be able to win these competitions so we think that you, as a competitor should know enough to atleast be able to complete some of the challenges at any of the competitions we send you to. If you have any questions about this course or the requirements, reach out to me on Discord (CTF Team Lead) or email (thomasc23@vt.edu)
